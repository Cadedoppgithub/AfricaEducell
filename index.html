								<h3>Cade Dopp</h3>
								<p>Cade Dopp started Educell because "it was more fun than watching Netflix". He enjoys working with students and teachers and loves to share his passion for education with his friends in Ghana.

								   <h3>What We Do</h3>

<p>
We help schools and teachers in Africa to use low-cost technology and free instructional materials to improve outcomes in their classrooms. 
  Our partner-teachers leverage digital assessments to instantly understand student needs, and multimedia instructional materials to personalize instruction for every student. 
  We install the technology, train the teachers, and provide the instructional material. 
  Check out our Projects page to see some examples of our work.
</p>


<h3>Our Mission</h3>

<p>
Our mission is to provide every child on this earth with an opportunity to gain knowledge about the world,
power to act in it,
and desire to be self-reliant and compassionate.
</p>

<h3>Guiding Beliefs</h3>

<p>
The Creator gave each of us life on this Earth so that we could learn to live happily, as He does. 
  Our capacity for happiness increases with our capacity to love. 
  Our capacity to love increases as we learn to see things as they really are, and as we acquire the power to act accordingly. 
  Gaining vision and power is the heart of education.

  <h3>Ghana Make A Difference</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.ghanamakeadifference.org/" target="_blank">Ghana Make A Difference</a> (GMAD) is an NGO that provides housing and basic necessities for children who have been rescued from human trafficking, abuse, and neglect.
      Dissatisfied with the community school, GMAD constructed a new school to serve their children and others in the community.
      The GMAD Accademy of Learning employed three full-time teachers, a special-needs teacher, and a vocational trainer.
      They served approximately 60 students. Teachers and students initially had limited competency with technology like computers and tablets.
      One of the unique challenges at GMAD is that students typically spend one year in the program, and enter and exit the program at unpredictable times.
    </p>

    <p>
      We partnered with GMAD to 
      <ol>
        <li> design a custom curriculum that focused on literacy and math </li>
        <li> create assessments to help determine student needs upon enrollment </li>
        <li> integrate low-cost tablets to enable automated assessments and delivery of personalized instruction</li>
        <li> setup a learning management system to track student progress and organize instructional materials </li>
      </ol>

									Are you feeling stuck? Like you want your life to move forward or look a certain way, but you just don’t know how to get there? It’s okay! The feeling of stagnation could be due to lack of motivation, anxiety, depression, grief, loss or low self-esteem. Feeling stuck could also be a result of not understanding your own needs and emotions, or relationship concerns between partners or parents and children. Whatever your concern may be, you will be okay- you just need some guidance! I love connecting with people and facilitating the discovery of healing and empowerment that will lead to living a meaningful life.

								</p>
								<p>
									I want to provide you with a safe space and listening ear to help you process your concerns and work through them. No judgement. I have experience working with teens, adults, couples and family units as they seek understanding and healing. I enjoy working with clients through mindfulness, ACT, EFT, CBT, DBT and motivational interviewing.

								</p>
								<p>
									Feeling lost, lonely or stuck can be sad, scary and overwhelming. It’s time to get some help to overcome those feelings! I am confident that our time together will make you feel heard and cared for. My goal is to give you the hope, skills and confidence you need to make your life what you want it to be. You don’t have to figure this out alone, reach out now!
